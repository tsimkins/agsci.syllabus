        <h2>Penn State Statements</h2>
        <h3>The Penn State Principles</h3>
        
        <p>The Pennsylvania State University is a community dedicated to personal and academic
        excellence. The Penn State Principles were developed to embody the values that we hope
        our students, faculty, staff, administration, and alumni possess. At the same time, the
        University is strongly committed to freedom of expression. Consequently, these
        Principles do not constitute University policy and are not intended to interfere in any
        way with an individual's academic or personal freedoms. We hope, however, that
        individuals will voluntarily endorse these common principles, thereby contributing to
        the traditions and scholarly heritage left by those who preceded them, and will thus
        leave Penn State a better place for those who follow.</p>
        
        <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
        
        <p>Penn State and the College of Agricultural Sciences take violations of academic
        integrity very seriously. Faculty, alumni, staff and fellow students expect each
        student to uphold the University's standards of academic integrity both in and outside
        of the classroom. Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open,
        honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all
        academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the
        University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle. Consistent
        with this expectation, students should act with personal integrity, respect other
        students' dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in
        which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts. Academic integrity includes
        a commitment not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, plagiarism,
        misrepresentation or deception. Such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical
        principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by
        others (see <a href="http://www.psu.edu/ufs/policies/47-00.html#49-20">Faculty Senate
        Policy 49&#8208;20</a> and <a href=
        "http://www.psu.edu/dept/oue/aappm/G-9.html">G&#8208;9 Procedures</a>.)</p>
        
        <p><a href="http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/conduct/codeofconduct">Code of Conduct and
        Student Conduct Procedures</a></p>
        
        <p><a href="http://agsci.psu.edu/students/resources/academic-integrity">Academic
        Integrity Guidelines for the College of Agricultural Sciences</a></p>
        
        <p>A lack of knowledge or understanding of the University's Academic Integrity policy
        and the types of actions it prohibits and/or requires does not excuse one from
        complying with the policy.</p>
        
        <h3>Nondiscrimination Statement</h3>
        
        <p>The University is committed to equal access to programs, facilities, admission and
        employment for all persons. It is the policy of the University to maintain an
        environment free of harassment and free of discrimination against any person because of
        age, race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, creed, service in the uniformed
        services (as defined in state and federal law), veteran status, sex, sexual
        orientation, marital or family status, pregnancy, pregnancy-related conditions,
        physical or mental disability, gender, perceived gender, gender identity, genetic
        information or political ideas. Discriminatory conduct and harassment, as well as
        sexual misconduct and relationship violence, violates the dignity of individuals,
        impedes the realization of the University's educational mission, and will not be
        tolerated. Direct all inquiries regarding the nondiscrimination policy to Dr. Kenneth
        Lehrman III, Vice Provost for Affirmative Action, Affirmative Action Office, The
        Pennsylvania State University, 328 Boucke Building, University Park, PA 16802-5901,
        Email: <a href="mailto:kfl2@psu.edu">kfl2@psu.edu,</a> Tel (814) 863-0471.</p>
        
        <h3>Disability</h3>
        
        <p>Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University's educational
        programs. Every Penn State campus has an office for students with disabilities. The
        Office for Disability Services (ODS) Web site provides <a href=
        "http://equity.psu.edu/ods/dcl">contact information for every Penn State campus</a>.
        For further information, please visit the <a href="http://equity.psu.edu/ods">Office
        for Disability Services Web site</a>.</p>
        
        <p>In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, you must contact
        the appropriate disability services office at the campus where you are officially
        enrolled, participate in an intake interview, and <a href=
        "http://equity.psu.edu/ods/guidelines">provide documentation</a>. If the documentation
        supports your request for reasonable accommodations, your campus's disability services
        office will provide you with an accommodation letter. Please share this letter with
        your instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early in your courses as
        possible. You must follow this process for every semester that you request
        accommodations.</p>
        
        <h3>Mental Health Services</h3>
        
        <p>Mental health services are available to help you maintain your academic success.
        <a href=
        "http://student.worldcampus.psu.edu/student-services/mental-health-services">Visit the
        student website</a> today to learn more or to speak with a mental health advocate who
        can help you address concerns including anxiety, depression, relationship difficulties,
